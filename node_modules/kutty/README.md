# Kutty

Kutty is a tailwind plugin for building web applications. It has a set of accessible and reusable components that are commonly used in web applications.

## Installation

```sh
npm install kutty --save
```

This plugin requires Tailwind CSS 3 or later. Tailwind CSS is not included in this package. Learn how to [install tailwind here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/).

## Usage

### For CSS

Require the installed plugin directly to your Tailwind config:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
plugins: [require("kutty")],
```

### For JS

We bundle AlpineJS v2.8.0 for reactivity in our components. Learn more about [AlpineJS here](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine). Place the following script tag before the closing body tag.

```html
<!-- All components in one -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/kutty@latest/dist/kutty.min.js"></script>
```

```html
<!-- Single component -->
<!-- Include AlpineJS first -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/kutty@latest/dist/alpinejs.min.js"></script>
<!-- And then the single component -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/kutty@latest/dist/dropdown.min.js"></script>
```
